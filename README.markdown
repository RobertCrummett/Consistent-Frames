From the
[paper](http://geodesy.unr.edu/publications/Blewitt_Ref_Frame_2003.pdf)
...

"The following key characteristics of degree-one
deformation are noted:
1. the Earth's surface remains a perfect sphere
that is displaced with respect to the original
sphere
2. the stations move closer together in the
Northern Hemisphere and further apart in the
Southern Hemisphere
3. the shape of the final polyhedron of stations
is frame invariant
4. the difference in sets of final station
coordinates in each frame is given by a common
translation (often called the 'geocenter')
5. in all frames the difference between initial
and final station coordinates can be described
by a frame-independent deformation plus a 
frame-dependent translation."

I think this figure reinforces the five key
points brought out splendidly. I also like the
topic of reference frames and earth deformation
at large scale, so this paper is on my favorite
list as well.
